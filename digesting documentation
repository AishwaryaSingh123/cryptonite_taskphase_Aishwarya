Pondering Paths

1. The Root

Challenge
Collect the flag by running the pwn program using its absolute path.

Thought Process
I needed to execute the pwn program using its absolute path, which starts from the root directory / in Linux.

Solution
  /pwn

  
2. Program and Absolute Paths

Challenge
Execute the run program located in the /challenge directory to collect the flag.

Thought Process
I had to run the run program from the /challenge directory by using its absolute path.

Solution
/challenge/run

3. Position Thyself

Challenge
Collect the flag by running the /challenge/run program from a specific directory.

Thought Process
I needed to switch to the correct directory, as running /challenge/run alone indicated I was not in the right place. 
  The error message pointed me to /usr/share/build-essential, so I navigated there.

Solution:
cd /usr/share/build-essential  
/challenge/run


4. Position Elsewhere

Challenge
Run the /challenge/run program from another specified directory.

Thought Process
Following the same logic as before, I had to move to the /var directory based on the error message.

Solution:
cd /var  
/challenge/run


5. Position Yet Elsewhere

Challenge
Run the /challenge/run program from a different specified path.

Thought Process
I needed to move to the /etc directory and execute the program as directed by the error message.

Solution:
cd /etc  
/challenge/run


6. Implicit Relative Paths, From /

Challenge
Run /challenge/run using a relative path while in the root directory /.

Thought Process
Since the current working directory (cwd) was /, I had to run the run program without using the full path. 
A hint mentioned the relative path starts with "c", which led me to think of the challenge directory. I removed the leading / to make it a relative path.

Solution:
cd /  
challenge/run


7. Explicit Relative Paths, From /

Challenge
Execute challenge/run using . in the relative path while being in the root directory /.

Thought Process
Since . represents the current directory, I needed to prepend it to the relative path to explicitly tell the system to run the program from the current directory.

Solution:
cd /  
./challenge/run


8. Implicit Relative Path

Challenge
Execute the run program using a relative path while the current working directory is /challenge.

Thought Process
When in the /challenge directory, executing the program directly as run wouldnâ€™t work because Linux doesn't search the current directory automatically. 
I needed to prepend ./ to run the program from the current directory.

Solution:
cd /challenge  
./run


9. Home Sweet Home

Challenge
Run /challenge/run with a file path argument following these constraints:

The argument must be an absolute path.
The path must be inside the home directory.
The argument must be three characters or fewer before expansion.
Thought Process
The ~ symbol expands to /home/hacker, my home directory. Using it along with a single character file name would meet the constraints.

/challenge/run ~/f
